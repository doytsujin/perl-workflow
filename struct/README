SQL Structures for Workflow System
========================================

This directory contains the SQL structures necessary for using DBI
persistence for the Workflow system. Each file contains two or more
DDL statements for creating the tables and other support
structures. Typically you'll just need to pipe the file into the
relevant client:

MySQL (workflow_mysql.sql):

  mysql -u user -p password databasename < workflow_mysql.sql

PostgreSQL (workflow_pg.sql):

  psql -U user -f workflow_pg.sql databasename

SQLite (workflow_sqlite.sql):

  sqlite dbfile.db < workflow_sqlite.sql

For other databases use the generic file 'workflow_other.sql'. The
only difference between it and the other types is how the ID fields
are created. The previous three use vendor-specific methods for
generating ID fields while the generic version just uses a random
eight-character string. Less readable, but still unique.
