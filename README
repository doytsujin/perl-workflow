INTRO
========================================

The 'Workflow' Perl module implements a standalone workflow system. It
aims to be simple but flexible and therefore powerful. Each piece of
the workflow system has a direct and easily stated job, and hopefully
you'll find that you can put the pieces together to create very useful
systems.

Read 'perldoc Workflow' for a more detailed introduction, sample usage,
interactions with your applications, and more.
