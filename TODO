TODO file for Workflow

- Address the sections marked with ## no critic scattered throughout the code
  base, this might be valid, but another perspective and suggestions for
  refactorings might be a good idea (patches?)

- follow up up Perl::Critic policies disabled and marked as TODO in the
  t/perlcriticrc file

- Look into inconsistent XML configuration for persisters, this might however 
  break backwards compatibility

- Add more tests of persister configurations, could the new SQLlite emulation
  modules be of interest for more testing? DBD::PgLite and related

- Document general workflow initialization phase and the call to the
  Workflow classes init method in a more general way

- Document relation between actions and validators

- Add support for string based configuration instead of file based (copying
  behavior from XML::Simple) ?

- Write more POD, including a tutorial

- Write more tests (we need better coverage)

- Investigate whether use warnings pragma, breaks too much backwards
  compatibility [TestingAndDebugging::RequireUseWarnings]

- Move some constant candidates to central place

- Investigate violations of Perl::Critic policy
  [Subroutines::ProhibitExplicitReturnUndef]

- Investigate violations of Perl::Critic policy
  [ValuesAndExpressions::ProhibitMagicNumbers]

- Added POD sections on diagnostics to all classes.

- Decide where to put the configuration for the built-in
  validators/conditions/actions? Should we make it part of the
  WorkflowFactory initialization process, maybe just keep the built-ins
  configured in a class that's distributed with the module? (We don't
  want to force people to reference a separate file every time...

- Make the action/description of initial history created configurable
  (optional?)

- Investigate possible integration with standardized XML format
