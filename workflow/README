INTRO
========================================

The 'Workflow' Perl module implements a standalone workflow system. It
aims to be simple but flexible and therefore powerful. Each piece of
the workflow system has a direct and easily stated job, and hopefully
you'll find that you can put the pieces together to create very useful
systems.

Read 'perldoc Workflow' for a more detailed introduction, sample usage,
interactions with your applications, and more.


INSTALLATION
========================================

To install this module type the following:

   perl Build.PL
   ./Build
   ./Build test
   ./Build install

QUICK START
========================================

The eg/ticket/ directory contains a configured workflow system. You
can access it in two ways:

  * a command-line application (ticket.pl)
  * a web application          (ticket_web.pl)

It does have requirements above those of the basic workflow system. These are:

 Module            Howto install with CPAN shell
 ===============================================
 DBD::SQLite       'install DBI DBD::SQLite'
 LWP               'install Bundle::LWP'
 Template Toolkit  'install Template'

(For Win32 systems you can get the Template Toolkit PPD from
http://openinteract.sourceforge.net/; the DBD::SQLite PPD is available
from ActiveState)

To initialize:

 perl ticket.pl --db

To run the command-line application:

 perl ticket.pl

To start up the standalone web server:

 perl ticket_web.pl
