Workflow Sample Application
========================================

As a sample of the workflow system here is a simple trouble ticket
system. A *very* simple system. It comes with two interfaces: a
command-line application and a simple standalone web server. Both are
interfaces to the same workflows and tickets.

The default setup uses SQLite, a standalone multi-platform database
that has a great Perl interface (DBD::SQLite) and requires no
setup. You can use a different database by modifying
'workflow_persister.xml' to use a different DBI database.

Here's how to initialize the system if you're using SQLite:

 perl ticket.pl --db

 
, assuming you're in the
'eg/ticket/' directory:

 $ sqlite ticket.db < ../../workflow_sqlite.sql
 $ sqlite ticket.db < ticket.sql
