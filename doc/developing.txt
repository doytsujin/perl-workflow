This is intended as a developer handbook for developers and maintainers of the
Workflow distribution.

This document is a collection of notes and are currently far from complete.
Feedback additions, corrections and suggestions are more than welcome.


PATCHES

Patches and PRs are more than welcome.

Changes are preferred accompanied by documentation and tests. If this is not the
case, please make an appropriate entry in the Changes file, which in-depth
describes the purpose/motivation of the patch and what it influences.

To create a patch using the diff command, use the following format:

    % diff -u file.new file.org > file.patch
    
    Using git to generate a patch

RELEASES

We aim for release early release often. We do currently not run with a beta
release schema.


RELEASING

In order to make a release the following steps should be taken. This process
will hopefully be automated at some point, perhaps using release from CPAN,
which supports both CPAN and SourceForge.

1. Close the changes file

    Insert proper version number in Changes file
    
    Insert date in Changes file
    
2. Clean the directory and prepare the for the build

    % dzil clean

3. Make sure all tests pass

    % dzil test

4. Make dist

    % dzil release

5. Upload to appropriate distribution channels like PAUSE/CPAN and Sourceforge

6. Make a tag in the SCM, see TAGGING above
